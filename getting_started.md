# Getting Started with E-utilities

Entrez Utilities (E-Utilities) is an Application Program Interface (API) that helps you gather data from most of the 40 NCBI Entrez database residing at the NCBI using queries. The databases include a variety of biomedical data, including nucleotide and protein sequences, gene records, three-dimensional molecular structures, and the biomedical literature.  The E-Utilities give you control over what fields to search, the data to retrieve, the data format, and how to share results.
